        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a freshman at University of California Riverside. I am currently undeclared but looking to pursue a degree in Human Resources. My two minors I am considering are Business Administration and Psychology/Sociology. The start of my sophomore year is when I will begin taking classes after I officially declare a major. As of right now I keep the undeclared incase I find something else that interests me.Right now I am in an English class, a Sports Education class, and Computer Science. I will continue to take my gened courses for the rest of the year. Next quarter I am signed up to take a math course, my continued course of english, and lastly a sociology class. My goal is to finish the majority of my gened classes before I begin with my major program. That way I can focus on my HR classes when I can begin them. <br><br>

        I am also on the women's volleyball team here at University of California Riverside. With being a college athlete comes a lot of responsibility. We have to learn to balance education and athletics! That comes with being repsibile, having good time management, and continuing to stay motivated throughout the year. Those qualities come very naturally for athletes, considering we have had to learn those our whole life and almost mastered them by the time college rolls around. One advantage of having those qualities is that it makes it easier once we graduate and begin our jobs. We have the responsibility for our bosses to trust and count on us, we have the time management to never show up late and to have our work done on time, and lastly we have the motivation to always strive to do better and come up with better ideas. When times get hard and complicated we know how to stay calm in pressure situations and find a way for it to work. <br><br>

        While I dont have too much experience being only a freshman, I do look forward to my experiences in the future. I am excited to learn more about the profession in Human resources. I have many family members who are in the same or similar profession and I enjoy hearing them talk about their opportunities. My plan at the start of my sophomore year is to begin classes for my major and begin to focus on my future. Some classes I look forward to taking are organizational theory and design, behavioral science, and performance management and assessment. I hope by my junior or senior year of college I would be able to get an internship to really gain as much experience and knowledge I can. My plan is to get my degree at the end of my fourth year of college and from there move back home and continue any education I can to pursue my major. That would be going back to school for my masters! My goal is to continue to get an education, possibly even go back again to get a PHD.
